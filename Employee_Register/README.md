# Vanakkam Ayya 

You give a problem this morning, 
what i actually did is created all the class based on the instruction manual, 
for the private variables i created a getter and setter, i use the getter very effectively and dont know where to use the setter so appadya vituten, next public abstract void showDetails(); use panni adhaa Employee class la overwrite panniten,then I use the interface and i really got confustion because i use system.out.println in the int statement so i changed to return type, andhaa two interface subject ah AttendanceEmployee la extend panni implement panniten, in the begining i use normal method and after final code i used scanner class, attendace array la print panna Arrays.to string use pannen but adhaa use panna import Arrays use pannapothaan Scanner class main function la mattum illa sub class layum use pannalanu kathukitten,
and finally i updated all in the main class. Thank you.
